## Login and Registration with Email Verification Project

This project is a web application that implements login and registration functionality with email verification, using **Laravel**, **Inertia.js**, and **React**.

## Technologies Used

- **Laravel**: PHP framework for backend management and API.
- **Inertia.js**: Allows the use of React with Laravel without the need for a separate API.
- **React**: JavaScript library for building interactive user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS (optional)**: For quick and customized styling.

## Main Features

- **User Registration**: Allows users to sign up with their email and password.
- **Login**: Authentication for registered users.
- **Email Verification**: After registration, an email is sent with a verification link.
- **Route Protection**: Only verified users can access certain sections of the application.
- **Password Reset**: Users can request a link to reset their password in process.
